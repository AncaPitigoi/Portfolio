## About me

Hello, I am Anca! I am currently a graduate student pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Analytics, concentrating on statistical modeling. I have always been passionate about statistics and data, 
and how certain aspects influence the world, the business and ultimately our actions. In my journey as a data analyst I hope to bring positive changes that can help organizations and society develop. 

During my studies, I have developed skills for identifying patterns and trends in complex datasets, using data mining and regression techniques.
I enjoy having walks early in the morning, creating clothes and tending to my orchid collection in the spare time. I also like to expand my knowledge and skills, and solving challenges give me great satisfaction.

This repository displays past and current projects I am working on, showcasing my skills and progress in the Data Analytics field.

# Mushrooms Selection
In order to find which mushrooms are safe to eat, the Decision Tree classification method is used. The dataset was first cleaned, exploratory data analysis was performed, the tree was built on the training dataset, optimization was applied, and finally the validation of the classification model results was achieved on the test set.

Report: [Decision Tree - Mushrooms Selection](https://ancapitigoi.github.io/mushrooms-selection/)

Code: [Decision Tree - Mushrooms Selection Code](https://github.com/AncaPitigoi/mushrooms-selection/blob/main/Decision%20Tree%20-%20Mushroom.R)

Skills: data cleaning, data visualization, classification, decision tree

Results: The most important features to look for when mushroom foraging are odor, spore print color, gill size, population, and habitat. The model is exceptional, but achieving perfect classification accuracy and precision is not common in practice, especially in real-world datasets with inherent complexities and noise.


# AirBnB Occupancy in Seattle
This dashboard presents different types of plots for the Seattle AirBnB rentals in 2016. Firstly three tables were joined using the ID of the listings, then the data was filtered to include only the relevant information for the project. The dashboard contains two bar charts, a map, a table, and a line plot.

Dashboard: [AirBnB Occupancy in Seattle](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anca.pitigoi/viz/AirBnBExercise_17123393960360/Dashboard1)

Skills: joining multiple tables, data visualization, creating map charts, dashboards, and plots

Results: Renting an apartment in certain zip codes can be more expensive on average because of the proximity to certain sightseeings. Moreover, the revenue is slowly increasing from February, with a peak near the winter holidays as expected. This information is helpful for any investor that wants to rent out an apartment and have the largest return on investment. It also makes sense to buy a larger apartement because the average price increases with size, and the competition is more scarcer.
