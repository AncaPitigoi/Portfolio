## About me

Hello, I am Anca! I am currently a graduate student pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Analytics, concentrating on statistical modeling. I have always been passionate about statistics and data, 
and how certain aspects influence the world, the business and ultimately our actions. In my journey as a data analyst I hope to bring positive changes that can help organizations and society develop. 

During my studies, I have developed skills for identifying patterns and trends in complex datasets, using data mining and regression techniques.
I enjoy having walks early in the morning, creating clothes and tending to my orchid collection in the spare time. I also like to expand my knowledge and skills, and solving challenges give me great satisfaction.

This repository displays past and current projects I am working on, showcasing my skills and progress in the Data Analytics field.
