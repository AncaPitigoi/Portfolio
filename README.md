## About me

Hello, I am Anca! I am currently a graduate student pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Analytics, concentrating on statistical modeling. I have always been passionate about statistics and data, 
and how certain aspects influence the world, the business and ultimately our actions. In my journey as a data analyst I hope to bring positive changes that can help organizations and society develop. 

During my studies, I have developed skills for identifying patterns and trends in complex datasets, using data mining and regression techniques.
I enjoy having walks early in the morning, creating clothes and tending to my orchid collection in the spare time. I also like to expand my knowledge and skills, and solving challenges give me great satisfaction.

This repository displays past and current projects I am working on, showcasing my skills and progress in the Data Analytics field.

# Mushrooms Selection
In order to find which mushrooms are safe to eat, the Decision Tree classification method is used. The dataset was first cleaned, exploratory data analysis was performed, the tree was built on the training dataset, optimization was applied, and finally the validation of the classification model results was achieved on the test set.

Report: [Decision Tree - Mushrooms Selection](https://ancapitigoi.github.io/mushrooms-selection/)

Code: [Decision Tree - Mushrooms Selection Code](https://github.com/AncaPitigoi/mushrooms-selection/blob/main/Decision%20Tree%20-%20Mushroom.R)

Skills: data cleaning, data visualization, classification, decision tree

Results: The most important features to look for when mushroom foraging are odor, spore print color, gill size, population, and habitat. The model is exceptional, but achieving perfect classification accuracy and precision is not common in practice, especially in real-world datasets with inherent complexities and noise.
